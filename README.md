Generate estimates of Arctic sea-ice density from Nansen Legacy Project 2020â€“2021 observations
_______________________________________________________________________________________
MATLAB codes are provided to convert Nansen Legacy observations from coring to sea-ice density estimates.
Codes also provide density estimates from historical observations and MOSAiC expedition.
Finally, parametrization of first-zear ice density from its temperature based on Nansen Legacy and MOSAiC is given.
